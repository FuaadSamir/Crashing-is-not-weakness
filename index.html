                </h3>
                <article class="blog-post">
                       <p>In the past decade, social media has moved from a place for communication  and connecting with friends to an online hell for almost everyone using it. We've drifted far from the actual purpose of these platforms. </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Studies report, in the last decade: 
                        <li>A 70% increase in anxiety and depression in teens and young adults.</li>
                        <li>Body image issues up by 62%, especially among girls aged 12-18.</li>
                        <li>Online harassment up by 65% across all age groups.</li>
                        <li>FOMO- Fear Of Missing Out, up by 60%.</li>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why should we be hopeful?</h2>
                    <p>The light at the end of this tunnel might be really dim, or might not even be visible to a lot of us. Yet its human nature to stay positive and keep trying.
